# Work Day Scheduler

## What It Is:
* Time management application for work days, to more effectively manage a busy working schedule (9AM - 5PM).

## Method
* This app was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Moment.js
* Bootstrap for the agenda's timeblocks
* CSS: color blocks change by time of day - grey for past, red for current timeblock, and green for future. Date displayed at the top of the page

## How to Use
* Type in your plans for the day in the timeblocks and click on the save icon to the right to save your changes.
